My solutions to problems from various websites. My workflow typically consists
of cloning the `Template.java` file as `Main.java` and working within the
latter file. Compile with and run with `javac Main.java ; java Main < in` where
`in` is a file containing the problem's inputs. For running locally with very
large inputs, be sure to increase the memory (`-Xmx512m`) and/or stack memory
(`-Xss512m`) as necessary. Upon receiving AC verdict, I rename the file to the
problem id and archive it for keepsake.

All code committed to this repo has received AC verdict, though not necessarily
optimal (wrt theoretical running time). Code submitted to contests with partial
scoring (i.e. Codechef) may also not have received full points.
