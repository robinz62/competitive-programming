# competitive-programming

My solutions to problems from various websites. My workflow typically consists
of cloning the `Template.java` file as `Main.java` and working within the
latter file. Compile with `javac Main.java` and run as `java Main < in` where
`in` is a file containing the problem's inputs. Upon receiving AC verdict, I
rename the file to the problem id and archive it for keepsake.

Note that while all code has received AC verdict, they may not be completely
optimal. Not that anyone besides me has ever or will ever look at the code.
Also, this repository does not contain all the problems I have ever solved but
oh well.
