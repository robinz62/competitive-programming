# competitive-programming

My solutions to problems from various websites. My workflow typically consists
of cloning the `Template.java` file as `Main.java` and working within the
latter file. Compile with `javac Main.java` and run as `java Main < in` where
`in` is a file containing the problem's inputs. For running locally with very
large inputs, be sure to increase the memory (`-Xms???m`) and/or stack memory
(`-Xmx???m`) as necessary. Upon receiving AC verdict, I rename the file to the
problem id and archive it for keepsake.

Note that while all code has received AC verdict, they are not necessarily
optimal (and certainly not always elegant lol). Not that anyone (including me)
will ever look at the code again. Also, this repository does not contain all
the problems I have ever solved but oh well.
